      <h2>About these deposit conditions</h2>
      <p>These deposit conditions set out the terms on which you may deposit any data in the Oxford University Research Archive (ORA). This deposit licence does not apply to the deposit of any other work in ORA, including publications, for which you should read the <a href="/deposit_licence">ORA deposit licence</a>. A list of defined terms is included at the end of these deposit conditions.</p>
      <p><strong>Please read these deposit conditions carefully before depositing any data in ORA. By depositing any data in ORA, you confirm that you accept, and have complied with, these deposit conditions.</strong></p>

      <h2>Conditions</h2>
      <p>By depositing any data in ORA, you confirm to the University that you have the legal right to deposit those data in ORA and to make those data available in ORA.</p>
      <p>The intellectual property rights in any data generated by University personnel will ordinarily be owned by the University. However, you should not take this position for granted. The rights in any data may be more complex where a research project was commenced at another organisation, or where any data was generated in collaboration with other organisations.</p>
      <p>If any data is the result of any activity sponsored, commissioned or otherwise supported by another person or organisation (e.g. under a funding or collaboration agreement), you confirm to the University that you have secured the permission of any such third party to deposit the data and complied with all conditions that may apply to the deposit of those data in ORA. </p>
      <p>Please contact Oxford Research Data queries at <a href="http://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/contact">http://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/contact</a> if you need help to understand the provisions of any research agreement relating to such data.</p>
      <p>In particular, you confirm that any such data does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>infringe any intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright or database right) of any other person or organisation;</li>
        <li>contain any confidential information; or</li>
        <li>contain any information that relates to an individual who can be identified from that information or from that information and any other information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any data deposited in ORA should only contain anonymous information. In determining whether or not any information is anonymous, you should have regard to the guidance of the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">UK Information Commissioner’s Office</a> and to any other guidance published by an organisation established to regulate or promote good practice in your field of research.</p>
